# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using YOLOv8 & EasyOCR

This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using **YOLOv8** for license plate detection and **EasyOCR** for text recognition. It includes training, evaluation, video processing, and a user-friendly **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## Problem Statement
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a critical technology for **traffic monitoring, toll collection, smart parking, law enforcement, and logistics tracking**. Traditional systems often struggle with challenges like:
- Low-light or poor weather conditions
- Motion blur from moving vehicles
- Non-standard or occluded license plates
- Varying plate sizes and fonts

This project addresses these challenges using **YOLOv8 for robust plate detection** and **EasyOCR for efficient text extraction**, providing a modular and deployable solution.

---

## Features
- **License Plate Detection** using YOLOv8
- **Text Extraction (OCR)** with EasyOCR
- **Video Inference** support
- **Evaluation Metrics & Visualization** (mAP, precision, recall, loss curves)
- **Streamlit Dashboard** for interactive demo
- Modular structure (`train.py`, `predict.py`, `evaluate.py`, etc.)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on **Roboflow Universe**.  
You can download it directly [from here](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4).  

The dataset contains images of vehicles and their corresponding annotated license plates, which were used for training and evaluation of the YOLOv8 + OCR pipeline.  

---

---

## Sample Video  

A sample video used for testing the detection pipeline can be downloaded [here](https://www.pexels.com/video/traffic-flow-in-the-highway-2103099/).  

This video showcases highway traffic flow and was used to demonstrate **real-time license plate detection and recognition** with the trained YOLOv8 + OCR model.

## Insights
- The **box_loss and cls_loss decrease steadily**, indicating the model is learning effective spatial and classification features.
- **Precision and recall are both high (>95%)**, showing balanced detection without significant false positives/negatives.
- The **mAP@0.5 (~98%)** confirms strong detection accuracy, while **mAP@0.5:0.95 (~70%)** suggests opportunities for improving small-scale/occluded plate recognition.
- OCR accuracy depends heavily on plate clarity; preprocessing (denoising, contrast adjustment) improves performance.

---

## Business Insights
- **Traffic Management**: Automates vehicle monitoring, enabling toll collection, congestion tracking, and real-time analytics.
- **Security & Surveillance**: Enhances law enforcement by detecting and logging suspicious or blacklisted vehicles.
- **Parking Solutions**: Enables smart parking by automating entry/exit systems, reducing manual intervention.
- **Logistics & Fleet Tracking**: Helps companies monitor fleet movement, improve accountability, and optimize delivery routes.
- **Revenue Generation**: Supports governments and businesses in toll automation, parking fees, and traffic fines collection.

---

## Future Improvements
- Improve OCR accuracy with preprocessing (denoising, contrast adjustment)
- Add **DeepSORT tracking** for multi-frame plate tracking
- Experiment with advanced backbones (BiFPN, FasterNet)
- Hyperparameter tuning for higher mAP
- Support for edge-device deployment
